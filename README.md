# VBA

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a Microsoft VBA-coded tool integrated with SAP2000 to optimize steel structures using the CLPSO algorithm. The project minimized steel member sizes by reducing total structural weight while ensuring stability. This enhanced my skills in structural analysis, algorithmic optimization, and computational modeling.
